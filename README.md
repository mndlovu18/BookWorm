# BookWorm

We have discovered that there are a lot of people who read books around Bryn Mawr College. As book lovers ourselves we like the idea of having a system where we can form a community with people who love reading books. Our system will create a community for book lovers and having this community will create an environment where avid readers can share book suggestions, read a book together  and discuss it. When people read and discuss  a book they get to engage with each other on a deeper level and this promotes closeness and wellbeing. In addition to that this app will help people create and commit to  reading habits as there will be people to help with accountability.


The important features for our system are:
1. The ability to post a discussion about a book a user finished reading. Before posting the comment, the user selects the type of book there were reading eg sci-fi, biography, so that their comment is put under the right column of books. 
2. The administration reads through all the comments and approves appropriate writings to be posted officially on the webpage. 
3. Other users are able to read the descriptions of all the books that are posted. In order to read descriptions on books close to oneâ€™s interests, users are able to filter the posts according to the book genre.
